               <span>Jacqueline Galdamez is currently a waiter at upscale
                restaurant Burton's Grill & Bar which serves American food.
                 Although she's been in the restaurant industry for four years
                she decided to make a change in careers by continuing her education. After saving money
                and doing a bunch of research she came across the web developement program provided by
                George Washington University. Having a passion for learning and improving has been her
                motivation to study Web Developement in which there is plenty of room for growth.
                What thrives her to want more in life would always be her family. Growing up with
                hispanic traditions she never lost touch of the culture and her family help her
                realize that opportunities shouldn't be taken for granted here in the US.
                She was born in Los Angeles, California, with spanish being her first language,
                but moved to Virginia at a young age. Being raised in the Alexandria area she's had
                quite a bit of experiences such as photography, cosmetology, and soccer.
